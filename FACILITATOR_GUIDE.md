# 🌿 interACT Facilitator Guide (v2.0)

Welcome to the newly upgraded interACT platform! We've implemented a series of professional enhancements designed to provide a "Gold Standard" experience for both you and your participants. 

---

## �️ 1. The interACT Hub (Central Portal)

The **interACT Hub** (found at `/portal`) is your central starting point. Instead of remembering multiple links, you can access everything from this one protected menu.

- **Access Link**: `https://www.theinteract.org/portal`
- **Security**: You will be asked for a **Secret Key**. Once entered, the portal will "remember" you on that device.
- **Tools Included**:
    - **Event Management**: The core tool for scheduling sessions.
    - **Facilitator Registration**: For adding new facilitators to the global database.
    - **Facilitator Guide**: Direct access to this digital handbook.
    - **Public Join Page**: A quick link to see what the students see.

## �🏗️ 2. Managing Events (Dashboard)

Access the **Events Dashboard** using yourスタッフ secret link:
`https://www.theinteract.org/events-dashboard?secret=interact2026`

### 🗓️ Multi-Session Support
You can now create events that span multiple days or sessions (e.g., a 3-day workshop).
- **Roadmap**: Each session appears in a vertical "Roadmap" on the public event page.
- **Granular Control**: For *every* individual session, you can toggle:
    - **Collect Feedback**: Enables the feedback button for that specific day.
    - **Certificate**: Determines if a certificate is offered after that specific session.

### 📍 Improved Location Handling
- **Country Selector**: Select the country from a dedicated dropdown. This now automatically sets the default country for participants when they fill out the feedback form.
- **Location**: Use the specific venue name (e.g., *Convention Center, Room 402*).

### 👥 Host / Conductor
- You must select a conductor from the list of **Registered Facilitators** or **Core Team**. This profile (name, role, and bio) is featured prominently to build credibility.

## 📜 2. The Professional Certificate System

We have upgraded the certificate system to a "Government/Ivy League" standard of prestige.

### 🎨 Design & Quality
- **High-Prestige Design**: Features an elegant double border, a silent "Institutional Seal" watermark, and professional Georgia typography.
- **Print-Ready Quality**: Certificates are generated as **High-Resolution PNGs (2x Retina Quality)**. This ensures they look ultra-sharp when printed or shared on LinkedIn.
- **Signatories**: Every certificate now features three official signatures:
    1. **Sakshi Kamlapure** (Chairperson)
    2. **Muralindran Mariappan** (Co-Founder)
    3. **Ayako Ichimaru** (Co-Founder)

### 📥 Download Flow
- **Non-Intrusive**: Certificates no longer download automatically (which can be annoying).
- **Manual Download**: After a participant submits feedback, a "Download Certificate" button appears on a dedicated success screen.
- **Control**: The form stays open until the participant is ready to close it, ensuring they don't lose their download link.

## 📝 3. The Feedback Journey

The participant feedback form is now smarter and more professional.

### 👤 Participant Identity
- **Full Name**: We now use a single `Full Name` field. 
    - *Tip*: Remind participants to type their name exactly as they want it printed on their certificate (e.g., including Dr., Sr., or middle initials).
- **Smart Phone Input**: 
    - The form automatically detects the event's country.
    - It pre-fills the correct **International Country Code** (e.g., +91 for India, +1 for USA).
    - Participants only need to type their local number.

## 📊 4. Reporting & Impact Analytics

### 📁 Exporting Data
Under the **"Manage Events"** and **"Reports"** tabs, you can export your data to CSV:
- **Registration Reports**: See who is coming.
- **Feedback Reports**: Deep dive into participant insights.
- **International Format**: All exported phone numbers now include the country code (e.g., `+91 9876543210`) for easy global communication.

### 🌟 Testimonial Logic
The website automatically scans all feedback and features the **top 5-star testimonials** on the public event page to inspire others.

## 🚀 Pro-Tips for Success

1. **Remind on Name**: During the session, tell participants: *"When you fill the feedback form, please enter your Full Name exactly as you want it on your certificate."*
2. **Photos are Key**: An event is only marked "Completed" once you upload high-quality snapshots. This automatically updates our "Past Impacts" global gallery.
3. **Download Assistance**: Some participants might miss the download button. You can always download a participant list from your dashboard to follow up or send certificates manually if needed.
